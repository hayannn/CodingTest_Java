## 392. Is Subsquence
---
### Problem
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if s is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

### Example
#### 예시 1
- Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
- Output: true
<br>

#### 예시 2
- Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
- Output: false

<br>

### Constraints
- 0 <= s.length <= 100
- 0 <= t.length <= $10^4$
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
